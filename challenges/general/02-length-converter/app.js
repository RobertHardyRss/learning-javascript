CHALLENGE: Create a length converter function
    
	Creating a function is a skill that'll be useful in many settings, and as 
	you progress, you'll be working on much more complicated functions than this 
	one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in 
	multiple professions and industries.

	Let's start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should
	include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.

	formula is: miles = kilometers / 1.609
